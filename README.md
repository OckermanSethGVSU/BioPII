# BioPII

BioPII (Biology Parallel Integral Image) is a Python package for performing sliding window analysis (SWA) on biological images. This package makes use of the integral image technique to drastically speedup SWA, enabling SWA analysis of images that would have been too large for previous SWA implementations. 

To use the package include the following statement at the top of your file: `from BioPII import PII`

## Performance Numbers
We tested our methods to determine its performance relative to past methods. We created a C++ SWA (referred to as DP-Naive) script which used dynamic programming to reduce the number of additions needed to be performed. DP-Naive SWA was already 400x faster than a naive approach (a simple four for loop approach) on small images and is used as the baseline for comparison to our integral-image-based methods.

*Note: SWA runtime in milliseconds on different image sizes; speedups relative to DP-Naive Solution*
